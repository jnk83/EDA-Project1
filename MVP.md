### Phase One (MVP)
* Identify the most heavily trafficked stations (entries and exits summed) by day for thirty days for the relevant time period in the year prior.
* Provide a list of the top 10 stations.

### Phase Two (Expanded Features)
* Identify which stations' traffic is more tourist heavy and exclude these stations from the list of recommended stations
* Identify which stations are located in lower and mid-Manhattan, where more tech companies are located. Prioritize these stations
* Include visualizations.
* Expand the data to more than one year for the period of year in question.

### Phase Three (Expanded Features)
* Use prior year data to forecast forward and determine the accuracy of the forecasts.
* For entries, utilize information on higher income residential areas, where tech workers are believed to reside, as a weight in station selection.
* Create visualizations incorporating this new information.
