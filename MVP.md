### Phase One (MVP)
* Identify the most heavily trafficked stations (entries and exits summed) by day for thirty days for the relevant time period in the year prior.
* Provide a list of the top 10 stations.

### Phase Two (Expanded Features)
* Identify entries and exits by time ranges during the day, as opposed to just the daily total.
* Include visualizations.
* Provide a list of the top stations by time of day  ( 8am to 10pm?), and provide supporting maps of the identified stations for the time ranges.
* Expand the data to more than one year for the period of year in question.

### Phase Three (Expanded Features)
* Use prior year data to forecast forward and determine the accuracy of the forecasts.
* For exits, utilize information on commercial areas for the tech industry as a weight in station selection.
* For entries, utilize information on higher income residential areas, where tech workers are believed to reside, as a weight in station selection.
* Create visualizations incorporating this new information.
